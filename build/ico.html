    <h1>Blockchaining Everything</h1>
<h2>WTF is Blockchain</h2>
<p>Blockchain is a network of distributed and decentralized systems to faciltate a procedure (of value) based on the needs of end-user on the underlying P2P network. In simple terms, it is a technology based on the concept of decentralizing some entity of value.</p>
<p>After Bitcoin was introduced in 2008-9, some anonymous person from Japan claimed to have built a solution to develop s/w on top of bitcoin in form of distributed digital ledgers. Digital Ledgers are nothing but a mechanism to process some entity of value (where the entity doesn't necessarily has to be in the financial domains) while other systems keep listening to it for changes.</p>
<h3>An example</h3>
<p>Consider 4 people: <code>A, B, C and D</code> to be the primary nodes on the network of a private blockchain. Here's how things work from there on:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Node A</code> has to send some money to <code>Node B</code>.</li>
<li><code>Node A</code> initiates a transaction request on the network.</li>
<li>The request gets enqueued for verification of issuer's status on the network.</li>
<li>Upon verification, the transaction is written on the personal public ledger of the <code>Node A</code>, hence it is visible to every other node across the network.</li>
<li>The transaction may contain some cyptocurrency being used. (generally it does)</li>
<li>A block is generated for that transaction which might contain other transactions from this node as well as from other nodes.</li>
<li>This newly generated block is added to the chain of existing blocks, where each block can store as many as <code>n</code> number of transactions (not limited to/of having some economic value). New blocks are generated every <code>10 minutes or so</code>.</li>
<li>Hence the transaction is assumed completed and added to the chain of transactions of the network.</li>
</ol>
