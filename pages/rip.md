S/W Requirement Specifications

#### Overview

The project aims at providing extensive services to the railway user by using the present parent backbone of the Indian Railway. Having an infomration portal could result in huge number of satisfied users with apt and to-date information about their travel journeys. We use the current railway backbone i.e., the unprocessed data for route network, track status, train directives, train number, train routes with specific station/platform enquiries, all being provided in real-time. Moreover, we can have a system to track the present train status (assuming it has been queried by the end-user beforehand) for the entire running course for last week i.e., we consider there could be a provision to display the train arrival-departure details for each of the running day.

Every user goes through a login-signup procedure before they can view/enquire any information of their choice. On signup the user recieves a email verification link to verify the signup on the email address they used at the time of registration on the portal. Upon successful verification every user gets redirected to the login procedure as an entry would have been made into the central database for that end-user. Their are many features that can be incorporated within thier portal by building it on the top of the present railway network.

#### What to expect

RIP works online to facilitate every visiting user to look into the extensive information of the Indian Railways. End-users can expect to receive in-depth information and services about the rail network.

#### What not to expect

The portal *does not* provides you a facility to book train tickets, instead you are redirected to the official booking site of Indian Railways.

#### Customers

Everyone. Primarily, the rail passengers. However, anyone can use the portal from child to adult.
